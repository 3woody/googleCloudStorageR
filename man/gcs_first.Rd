\usage{
gcs_first(bucket = Sys.getenv("GCS_SESSION_BUCKET"))

gcs_last(bucket = Sys.getenv("GCS_SESSION_BUCKET"))
}
\arguments{
\item{bucket}{The bucket holding your session data. See Details.}
}
\description{
Place within your \code{.Rprofile} to load and save your session data automatically
}
\details{
The folder you want to save to Google Cloud Storage will also need to have a yaml file called \code{_gcssave.yaml} in the root of the directory.  It can hold the following arguments:

\itemize{
 \item [Required] \code{bucket} - the GCS bucket to save to
 \item [Optional] \code{loaddir} - if the folder name is different to the current, where to load the R session from
 \item [Optional] \code{pattern} - a regex of what files to save at the end of the session
 \item [Optional] \code{load_on_startup} - if \code{FALSE} will not attempt to load on startup
}

The bucket name is also set via the environment arg \code{GCE_SESSION_BUCKET}. The yaml bucket name will take precedence if both are set.

The folder is named on GCS the full working path to the working directory e.g. \code{/Users/mark/dev/your-r-project} which is what is looked for on startu√¶.  If you create a new R project with the same filepath and bucket as an existing saved set, the files will download automatically when you load R from that folder (when starting an RStudio project).

If you load from a different filepath (e.g. with \code{loadir} set in yaml), when you exit and save the files will be saved under your new present working directory.

Files with the same name will not be overwritten.  If you want them to be, delete or rename them then reload the R session.

This function does not act like git, or intended as a replacement - its main use is imagined to be for using RStudio Server within disposable Docker containers on Google Cloud Engine (e.g. via \code{googleComputeEngineR})


For authentication for GCS,
 the easiest way is to make sure your authentication file is
 available in environment file \code{GCS_AUTH_FILE},
 or if on Google Compute Engine it will reuse the Google Cloud authentication
 via \link[googleAuthR]{gar_gce_auth}
}
\examples{

\dontrun{

## within your .Rprofile file
.First <- function(){
  cat("\\n# Welcome Mark! Today is ", date(), "\\n")

  ## will look for download if GCS_SESSION_BUCKET env arg set
  googleCloudStorageR::gcs_first()
}


.Last <- function(){
  # will only upload if a _gcssave.yaml in directory with bucketname
  googleCloudStorageR::gcs_last()
  message("\\nGoodbye Mark at ", date(), "\\n")
}

### example _gcssave.yaml contents -------------
# The GCS bucket to save/load R workspace from
bucket: my-bucket-for-r-projects
# set to FALSE if you don't want to load on R session startup
load_on_startup: TRUE
# on first load, whether to look for a different directory on GCS than present getwd()
loaddir: /Users/mark/other-computer/projectname
# regex to only save these files to GCS
pattern: "\\\\.R$"

}
